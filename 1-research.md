#### High Density Bioreactor (HDBR)  

![HDBR](/assets/HDBR/HDBR_Schematic.png)  
*Schematic of a High Density Bioreactor (HDBR) (not to scale). The Reactor (R) is composed of a 1,000 ml graduated cylinder with ports (hose barbs, outside diameter 3/8") installed at the 100 ml and 1,000 ml levels. Reactor fluid is cycled through the reactor using peristaltic Pump A (PA), entering at the bottom of the reactor and flowing upwards through the biomass zone (BZ) towards the top port. Fluid exits the reactor at the top port and is directed to the recycle tank (RT) under gravity. The RT is composed of a 600 ml glass beaker; it has two ports installed, one located at the bottom of the beaker and the other at the 500 ml mark. Reactor fluid is returned to the reactor via the bottom port (and PA). Effluent leaves the reactor via the top port of the RT and is collected in a Waste container (W). Diffusive aeration is provided in the RT with the use of an aerator (A). The aeration process also drives mixing within the MV. Peristaltic Pump B (PB) delivers influent from a tank containing feed/influent (FT) into the RT.* **[Figure and caption adapted from Price et. al. 2015]**

#### British Petroleum Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill

#### Nutrient conditions within the beaches of the Delaware River 

The goal of this project was to characterize nutrient content and cycling within the beaches/shorelines of the Delaware River. The study sites were located on Tinicum Island, which is located in the Delaware River next to the Philadelphia International Airport. 

*Collecting porewater samples.* ![Porewater Samples](/assets/DelawareRiver/PorewaterSamples.jpg){:height="25%" width="25%"}  

![oil droplets](/assets/DelawareRiver/OilDroplets.jpg){:height="25%" width="25%"} *There have been many, many smaller scale spills on the Delaware River. Even assuming proper remediation is carried out each of these events leaves oil behind which is released over time.*  

*Gigantic tarball on one of the beaches.* ![tarball](/assets/DelawareRiver/Tarball.jpg){:height="25%" width="25%"}  

![refinery and trash](/assets/DelawareRiver/OilRefineryandTrash.jpg){:height="25%" width="25%"} *Lots of trash at the head of the island.*
