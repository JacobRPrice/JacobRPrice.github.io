### Current Projects  
#### [High Density Bioreactor (HDBR)](/pages/HDBR.md)  

The novel architecture/arrangement of the High Density Bioreactor (HDBR) allows researchers to grow very high density microbical cultures. Thus far the HDBR system has been used to successfully grow and study a wide variety of mixed community cultures:  
* Alage and cyanobacteria  
* Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification  
* Heterotrophic bacteria within activated sludge  
* Fermentation with yeast

#### [Enhanced Biological Phosphorous Removal (EBPR)](/pages/EBPR.md)  

Enhanced biological phosphorous removal (EBPR) is a biotechnology used to remove excess or remaining P from municipal or industrial waste streams. This process takes advantage of a group of organisms called phosphate accumulating organisms (PAO), such as *Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis*. These interesting organisms are notable for being capable of accumulating/storing large amounts of phosphate within their cells.
