I've served as a teaching assistant at both Drexel University and Temple University. In addition to my formal functions as TA, I've mentored and/or supervised a number of undergraduate and high school students through Drexel's [STAR Scholars Program](http://drexel.edu/undergraduate-research/STAR-scholars/STAR-scholars/) (Students Tackling Advanced Research) and the Franklin Institutes [STEM Scholars](https://www.fi.edu/stem-scholars-program) program. Before coming to Drexel, I was also involved in the [Scientists as Teachers - Teachers as Scientists NSF program](https://www.cst.temple.edu/sat-tas/) at Temple University, which focuses on bringing graduate students and STEM teachers together to share laboratory and classroom space and time. Bringing these two groups together enriches their background and perspectives by allowing teachers to experience graduate-level research and exposes graduate students to instructional opportunities. I was lucky enough to be paired with [Jessica McAtamney](https://www.sp2.upenn.edu/people/view/jessica-naugle-mcatamney/) during my tenure at TAS-SAT while she was the A.P. Environmental Science Teacher for W.B. Saul Agricultural High School, well before she became the current VP at Philadelphia School District's Vaux Big Picture High School (she's kind of a big deal, and awesome to boot).
