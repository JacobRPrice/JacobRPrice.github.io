Much of my work is done within the R programming language. Its open-source nature and abundance of packages and users makes it a powerful resource for a wide variety of fields and disciplines.

# theseus - an R package for microbial ecology   
"Official" DESCRIPTION: An approach to the visualization, analysis, and interpretation of (microbial) community composition data, especially those originating from amplicon sequencing. Analysis techniques include constrained and unconstrained ordination and visualizing taxonomic abundances and spatial patterns, among others. Methods intended to assist bioinformaticians and ecologists in selecting read trimming by quality scores and preprocessing/denoising of datasets are also provided.
