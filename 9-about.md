### About me
I'm a PhD candidate studying under [Chris Sales](http://microbes.cae.drexel.edu/) at Drexel University.  

My dissertation topic involves studying how microbial community composition drives nutrient uptake and transformation within photobioreactors. My primary focus is on nitrogen (NH4, NO2, NO3) and it's interaction with organic and inorganic carbon within these systems. To study this, I use a novel bioreactor called a High Density Bioreactor (or HDBR for short). You can read more about the HDBR system on my [Research](/1-Research.md) page. 

My background is fairly unusual for my current position. I recieved a B.S. in Mathematics (with Statistics Minor) from The Pennsylvania State University and worked as an actuary before deciding I wanted to do something more rewarding. I enrolled in the Environmental Engineering graduate program at Temple University, where I recieved my M.Eng. with a certificate in Stormwater Management. While studying at Temple, I worked under [Michel Boufadel](https://civil.njit.edu/people/boufadel.php), now at NJIT, and [Rob Ryan](https://engineering.temple.edu/person/ryan-robert-j). 

The research I performed at Temple exposed me to a variety of principles from biology, biochemistry, and molecular biology. I've always had a deep interest in science in general, but this exposure engendered a passion for understanding the biological world at the small scale. Until the recent past, many disciplines within environmental engineering have considered reactor processes (e.g. wastewater treatment plants, anaerobic digesters, fermenters, etc) to be "black boxes". Descriptions of how these black boxes function and methods of thier operation heavily rely on a number of overarching assuptions (hello Monod equations!) and empirical data. The problem with this treatment, is that by definition, we don't know what is truly happening within the black box. 

I came to firmly believe that unraveling the biological processes within microbial systems and including information about ecological concepts such as competition, syntropy, antagonistic interactions is absolutly vital for not only understanding how these reactors work, but will ultimately guide us in the design and operation of engineered systems. I joined the [Sales lab group](http://microbes.cae.drexel.edu/) to expand my research beyond the chemical/kinetic into the molecular and ecology fields. 

I invite you to review my [Research page](/1-Research.md) for descriptions of the projets I'm currently working on, as well as project I've worked on in the past.
