I'm an applied microbiologist with a diverse background in environmental engineering, environmental microbiology, freshwater ecology, and soil science. 

I have been fortunate enough to contribute to a variety of projects that explore nutrient (N and C) cycling in microbial communities, water quality in freshwater streams, the impact of agricultural practices on soil health and crop yield, and the development of microbially-based technologies such as photobioreactors and concrete repair. 

**I am driven to improve environmental health in the world around us by facilitating a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the transport and transformation of nutrients and contaminants.** 
I am proficient in experimental design, data analysis, and cross-disciplinary collaboration, I have a demonstrated ability to apply scientific theory to solve real-world environmental challenges. I am passionate about driving impactful research that bridges engineering, ecology, and microbiology to promote sustainability and resilience in both infrastructure and natural systems. 
**Please contact me if you are interested in collaborating or believe I can contribute to an existing project.** 

My most recent position was at Drexel University, where I assisted with the development of a self-healing concrete technology using bacteria and fungi. At The Stroud Water Research Center I evaluated how the conversion of conventionally managed farmland to organic farming practices impacted soil health, runoff quality and volume, and surface- and groundwater quality. My earlier work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison involved applying statistical approaches to address classification challenges related to microbial community (amplicon) sequencing data, contributing to the advancement of microbiome analysis techniques. 

I received my PhD in Environmental Engineering from Drexel University while studying under Dr. Christopher Sales. I earned my MS in Environmental Engineering fron Temple University under the guidance of Dr. Robert Ryan and Dr. Michel Boufadel. I graduated from The Pennsylvania State University, majoring in Mathematics and Actuarial Science, and minoring in Statistics. 

I invite you to review my [research page](1-research.md) for descriptions of current and past projects I've been involved in.
