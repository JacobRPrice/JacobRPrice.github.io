title: Why Homebrew? 
---

On January 16, 1920 the 18th Ammendment of the US Constitution took effect, outlawing the production, transport, and sale of ethanol for human consuption. Conneticut and and the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations were the only states (of 48 at the time) to reject the ammendment, Pennslyvania was the 45th and second to last holdout after New Jersey. 

Almost 14 years later, on December 5, 1933, the 21st Ammendment was passed, nullifying the bulk of the 18th Ammendment. Once again, Pennsylvania was the second to last of the ratifiers. As a 3rd-4th generation Pennsylvanian, I have to admit I'm a little disapointed in PA's actions during the entire affair. That said, I have to give some PA residents some credit, the Yuengling family delivered their famous beer to FDR (at the White House) the day AFTER prohibition was repealed. Quite the feat for a process that typically takes 2-4 weeks. 

Despite many of the changes that occured, personal production of alcohol was still illegal due to the purposefully narrow language used within the ammendment. For example, homebrewing, vinting, and distillation of spirits were still illegal. In 1978 President Carter signed [HR 1337](https://www.congress.gov/bill/95th-congress/house-bill/01337) into law, legalizing the homebrewing of beer and vinting of wine. Interestingly, the omission of distillation from the law, a contentious point, directly leads to today's market structure, where a litteral handful of distillers control north of 99% of the legal spirits production. I like to consider this to be a great example for legacy Blue Laws.  

So where does this take us?
