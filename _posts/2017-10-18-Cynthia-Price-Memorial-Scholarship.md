---

One year ago, my family experienced the unexpected loss of my mother Cynthia Price. We decided to memorialize her by establishing a scholarship in her name at the [Pennsylvania College of Art & Design](http://pcad.edu/) (PCA&D), located in Lancaster, PA.   

Today, I am very happy to announce that [Leah Walt](https://www.leahlimpertwalt.com/) has been selected as the recipient of the Cynthia E Price Memorial Scholarship.  You can read more about the award on PCA&D's announcement [here](http://engage.pcad.edu/blog/leah-walt-receives-cynthia-price-scholarship). 


## About Cynthia E. Price  
*I had the honor of writing her obituary, and so I'm copying it directly.*

> Cynthia E. Price, 57, of Lancaster, PA, passed away on Tuesday, October 18, 2016. She was born in Lancaster to Kenneth G. and Anna May Ebersole.  
> Cynthia was a local artist, interior decorator, and craftswoman. Early experimentation with the visual arts attracted her to painting and cartooning; she graduated with an Associates Degree of Art from the Art Institute of Pittsburg in 1978. Upon graduation, she created advertisements for local businesses before starting her first company, Illusions in 1994, specializing in interior decoration and faux finishes, eventually expanding into refurbishing and repurposing antique furniture. In 2007, she began to concentrate on her painting, taking queues from the natural landscape she experienced as a child growing up in Lancaster County and during her travels abroad, to produce rich and accessible representations of the world she saw around her. Her stylistic monogram and initial designs led her to open a small shop, Love Letters, at Building Character, where demand for her paintings, unique furniture, and decorative accessories enabled expansion and transition into what is now known as Sanctuary.  
> While professionally successful, Cynthia always considered herself first and foremost a wife, mother, grandmother, and friend. Her warm and welcoming personality and buoyant carriage made her a central feature in her family’s lives, serving others around her as a unique and always highly fluid mix of friend, parent, confidant, prankster, and guide. She is remembered best for her ability to find the light in the darkest of times, and to dance whenever music could be heard.  
> Cynthia is survived by her husband of 36 years, J. Richard “Rick” Price of Lancaster, PA; two sons, Jacob R. Price, husband of Megan E. of Philadelphia and Jordan T. Price, husband of Jacquelyn C. and three grandchildren Sophia A., Evelyn M., and Mason A. Price, all who live locally.
