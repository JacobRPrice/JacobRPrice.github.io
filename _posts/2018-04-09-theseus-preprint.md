I've written [before](https://jacobrprice.github.io/2017/12/22/Introducingtheseus.html) about [theseus](https://jacobrprice.github.io/4-R.html), an R package that Steve Woloszynek and I have been working on which attempts to provide some tools we think are absent from some of the wonderful functionality that's already available within the R programming environment. 

Today, I'm happy to announce that our preprint describing theseus is [up on biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/04/05/295675) or on my [publications page](https://jacobrprice.github.io/2-publications.html).

We'd love to hear some feedback from some early users, especially if you have ideas on how it can be expanded or improved.
