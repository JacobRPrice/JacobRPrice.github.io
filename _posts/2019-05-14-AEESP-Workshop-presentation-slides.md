title: 2019 AEESP Workshop - Lecture Slides - Statistical considerations for omic data analysis
author: Jake Price
---

My contribution to this years AEESP Workshop *Meta-omics in Environmental Engineering Research. Theory, Statistics, and Data Interpretation* is a talk titled **Statistical considerations for 'omic data analysis**.  With such little time, I'm afraid I was only able to scratch the surface, but I hope it was enough to awaken some interest and be of some help! 

Outline:   
* data structures   
* transformations and distances   
* ordination    
* clustering   
* Hypothesis testing: PERMANOVA, ANOSIM, & differential abundance testing
