There's a big piece of news that hasn’t quite leaked its way out yet...   

**[Christopher M. Sales](http://microbes.cae.drexel.edu/people/dr-sales) has been granted tenure and promotion from Assistant Professor to Associate Professor.**

*This is the face of a man who doesn't toot his own horn to the point it’s almost annoying.*   

Chris, a professor in the CAEE department at Drexel University, was my PhD advisor and I would experience difficulty overstating his ability as an educator and mentor; I really lucked out. So, you may ask, why isn’t *he* the one making the announcement... well, he’s a soft-spoken guy who doesn’t particularly like to draw attention to himself. Lucky for him then, that I’m here to make sure the word gets out. 

Chris’ research interests are varied but all fall within the goals of remediating our environmental messes and harnessing the power of microbes to produce valuable products or effects. In addition to his research, (graduate student) mentoring, and teaching obligations, he devotes a considerable portion of his time to engaging high-school and undergraduate students and advancing the goals of scientific outreach through programs like the STAR Scholars and the Franklin Institute STEM Scholars.  

Congratulations Chris, you’ve earned it!
