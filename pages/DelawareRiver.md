**Please excuse the absence of content. This page is under construction.**


The goal of this project was to characterize nutrient content and cycling within the beaches/shorelines of the Delaware River. The study sites were located on Tinicum Island, which is located in the Delaware River next to the Philadelphia International Airport. 

*Collecting porewater samples.* ![Porewater Samples](/assets/DelawareRiver/PorewaterSamples.jpg){:height="25%" width="25%"}  

![oil droplets](/assets/DelawareRiver/OilDroplets.jpg){:height="25%" width="25%"} *There have been many, many smaller scale spills on the Delaware River. Even assuming proper remediation is carried out each of these events leaves oil behind which is released over time.*  

*Gigantic tarball on one of the beaches.* ![tarball](/assets/DelawareRiver/Tarball.jpg){:height="25%" width="25%"}
