**Please excuse the absence of content. This page is under construction.**

Enhanced Biological Phosphorous Removal (EBPR) is a wastewater treatment process that utilizes polyphosphate accumulating organisms' (PAOs) ability to take up large amounts of phosphate into their biomass, removing it from the waste stream. These removal processes typically operate in alternating anaerobic/aerobic cycles to create the conditions required for this to take place. 

During the anaerobic phase, organic carbon sources are converted to and stored as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) within PAO cells. 

In the aerobic phase, PHAs  are used to
