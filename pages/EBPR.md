title: Enhanced Biological Phosphorous Removal (EBPR)
---
Enhanced biological phosphorous removal (EBPR) is a biotechnology used to remove excess or remaining P from municipal or industrial waste streams. This process takes advantage of a group of organisms called phosphate accumulating organisms (PAO), such as *Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis*. These interesting organisms are notable for being capable of accumulating/storing large amounts of phosphate within their cells.   

(Simplfying greatly,) EBPR processes typically involve passing waste/mixed liquor through two stages, anaerobic and aerobic, sequentially.  

**Anaerobic Cycle**  

Under anaerobic conditions these PAOs are capable of importing a number of simple organic carbon compounds and converting/storing them as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). During this process PAOs break down polyphosphate (Poly-P) stored within thier cells and export orthophosphate to the extracellular medium. 

**Aerobic Cycle**  
In aerobic conditions PAO metabolism shifts dramatically reversing the previous processes. PHAs are consumed to support cell growth and maintenence as well as replenishing Poly-P reserves by importing orthophosphate.   

The consecutive and aggregate action of these two cycles is the removal of orthophosphate from a waste stream by concentrating it within PAO cells which are then easily removed from suspension via settling.
